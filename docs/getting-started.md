### API Protocols

Our APIs follow the general principles of REST, ensuring a structured and predictable approach to communication.

We use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and PUT to interact with resources, allowing clients to retrieve, create, and update data as needed.

All responses are returned in JSON format, making it easy to parse and integrate with various applications. HTTP response codes are used to indicate the status of requests, including successful operations and any errors that may occur.

When making API requests, you must include a Content-Type header set to application/json to ensure proper data formatting and processing.

Additionally, all API endpoints require authentication using your unique API keys to secure access and protect sensitive information.
